# IBM_ds_CapstProject
IBM Data Science and Machine Learning Capstone Project
In this capstone project, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
As a starting point of almost all data science projects, we need to:
1-collect data from various sources
2-improve the quality by performing data wrangling
3-explore the processed data (QL queries and data visualization)
4-build, evaluate, and refine predictive models
